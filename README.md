Software Development Academy. Final Project. Pool Attendance app

The idea is to have an app where administrator can keep a record of the attendance of participants in the regular event, make payment balance.   
User (eg. parents) can view the attendace and payment balance (eg. of child in the regular pool sessions).

Additional features include:
- user roles admin and user-parent (eg. parent of participant) 
                                                   
ADMIN:
- CRUD participant 
- make a personal monthly balance and balance of the whole period (eg. semester)
- sent e-mail to user-parent with payment balance - 
- choose payment type: 1) charged by the fact, 2) fixed monthly payment 
- make personal statistics of attendance 
- make anonymous statistics of group attendance viewable by user

USER:
- view personal data of attendance
- view personal payment balance
- view anonymous statistics of group attendance (+ compared to user)
- make payment 
- send comment to admin
