User (eg. parents) can view the attendace and payment balance (eg. of child in the regular pool sessions).

Additional features include:
- user roles admin and user-parent (eg. parent of participant) 
- CRUD participant 
- make a personal monthly balance and balance of the whole period (eg. semester)
- sent e-mail to user-parent with payment balance  
- make personal statistics of attendance 
- show anonymous statistics of group attendance to user
